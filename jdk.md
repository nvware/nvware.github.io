It appears you’re referencing different distributions of the Java Development Kit (JDK), and each item seems to be a shorthand or a directory name for a respective JDK build or variation. I’ll provide an overview of each:

*.corretto-21.0.1:*
Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK). Corretto is designed to provide long-term support with performance enhancements and security fixes.

.graalvm-ce-17:
GraalVM Community Edition is a high-performance JDK distribution that improves the efficiency, memory usage, and speed of Java applications. It is designed to support new and existing Java-based languages and has a polyglot capability to support mixing multiple languages.

.graalvm-jdk-21.0.1:
This likely refers to a specific version of GraalVM based on JDK 21.0.1, which is not officially released yet as of my last update in early 2023. GraalVM is versioned differently, so the version you’ve mentioned could either be speculative or a custom distribution.

.jbr-17.0.9:
This seems to refer to JetBrains Runtime, which is a fork of the OpenJDK with some modifications and optimizations made by JetBrains. It usually comes bundled with IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs.

.jbrsdk-17.0.9:
This would be the software development kit variant of the JetBrains Runtime, including the tools needed for development in addition to the runtime environment.

.liberica-21.0.1:
Liberica JDK is another version of the OpenJDK provided by BellSoft. Liberica JDK is fully compatible with the OpenJDK and is designed to be used in any environment, from servers to desktops to clouds.

.openjdk-21.0.1:
OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition. The number here would typically indicate the version of the JDK, though version 21 has not been released as of my last update.

.sapmachine-21.0.1:
SapMachine is an OpenJDK release maintained and supported by SAP. It aims to provide a well-supported and stable JDK for its customers and users of SAP software.

.semeru-18.0.2:
IBM Semeru Runtime Open Edition is a certified OpenJDK distribution that provides the Java community with a high-performance runtime consisting of the Eclipse OpenJ9 VM and the OpenJDK class libraries.

.temurin-21.0.1:
Eclipse Temurin is a high-quality, enterprise-grade OpenJDK distribution from the Eclipse Foundation. It aims to provide a secure, stable, and supportable JDK for enterprise users.

The numbers following each JDK name (21.0.1, 18.0.2, etc.) typically represent the version of the Java Platform they are built upon, indicating the feature set and APIs available. The JDK version numbers typically follow a release schedule, and Oracle has shifted to a new version numbering format with the Java Platform since Java 9. The versions mentioned in your list may not all correspond to actual or available versions, as some builds, like 21.0.1, do not exist according to traditional numbering.
